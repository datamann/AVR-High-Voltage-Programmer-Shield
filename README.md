# AVR High Voltage Programmer Shield

This project is a clone of https://github.com/4x1md/avr_frs_shield which in turn are a clone of https://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/09/arduino-based-avr-high-voltage-programmer/

While programming atmega328p QTFP MCU I managed to "brick" one and the only way to "reset" an AVR MCU you need an high voltage programmer.

I've made a Arduino UNO shield which is inspired by the project mention above.

You will find the schematics and pcb here (has not been tested yet):
